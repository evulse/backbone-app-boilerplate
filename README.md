BEHOLD, THE FRONTEND!
========================

Simple front-end app which talks with the express-api-boilerplate.

## Whatchu talkin'bout mister? Nomnomnom.

So uh, yeah. Here's the plan. The designs will be sliced using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). For this purpose only, we use [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and [Livereload](http://livereload.com/) to get things up and running in a blink of an eye. Okay, maybe a little slower.

## That's a lot of javascripts..

Uh-oh. Don't get groggy the first time. I already put it inceptionally, so you'd drown. Keh-keh-keh. We'll use [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) to organize the god-please-don't-let-it-get-messy [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) app. To get you excited, the BDD framework is presented in [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/). Neat huh?

So this is how it started.
========================

Please read and use the `.editorconfig` file so we don't get tangled in different coding standard across platforms. Read [here](http://editorconfig.org/).

## Directories.
- *assets* : CSS + Images. Nuff said.
- *js* : the Backbones (haha) is dwelling in the `app` directory, `libs` is for vendor-endorsed.. well, libraries. `test` is pretty much self-explanatory.
- Later we will also have a production-specific directory structures, but for now let me say [I love you](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamiecullum/butfornow.html).
